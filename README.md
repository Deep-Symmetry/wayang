# Wayang

A Java library for displaying images on the
[Ableton Push 2](https://www.ableton.com/en/push/) instrument. The
project name, which refers to
[Javanese shadow puppet artistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayang),
was chosen because it ties together the concepts Java, Push, and
images.

## Usage

Wayang bundles
[usb4java](http://usb4java.org/quickstart/javax-usb.html) to
communicate with the Push. For that to work, you need to have
[libusb](http://libusb.info) installed on your system. If you are on
Linux it is likely already installed, or you can follow their
installation instructions. On the Mac, I recommend using
[Homebrew](http://brew.sh) for all such needs; once it&rsquo;s
installed, you can simply run `brew install libusb`.

> If you are already using the
> [Open Lighting Architecture](https://www.openlighting.org/ola/),
> perhaps through
> [Afterglow](https://github.com/brunchboy/afterglow#afterglow), then
> libusb was installed as part of installing OLA.

Wayang is available through Maven Central, so to use it in your Maven
project, all you need is to include the appropriate dependency.

[![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/org.deepsymmetry/wayang/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/org.deepsymmetry/wayang)

Click the **maven central** badge above to view the repository entry
for Wayang. The proper format for including the latest release as a
dependency in a variety of tools, including Leiningen if you are using
Wayang from Clojure, can be found in the **Dependency Information**
section.

Once you have the Wayang library added as a dependency, all you need
to do to draw to the Push display is:

```java
import org.deepsymmetry.Wayang;

// ...

        BufferedImage displayImage = Wayang.open();
        Graphics2D graphics = displayImage.createGraphics();

// Perform whatever Java2D drawing operations you'd like to using the graphics object,
// then, whenever you want to update what is showing on the Push:

        Wayang.sendFrame();

// If you are done talking to it, you can close, as below. Otherwise, the library cleans
// up for you when the JVM exits.

        Wayang.close();

```

The image you get from `Wayang.open()` is 960 pixels wide and 160
pixels tall, the same as the physical display. These values are also
available as the constants `Wayang.DISPLAY_WIDTH` and
`Wayang.DISPLAY_HEIGHT`.

## Push Interface Documentation

Ableton has released the documentation that enabled the creation of
this library as its own project on Github,
[push-interface](https://github.com/Ableton/push-interface).
