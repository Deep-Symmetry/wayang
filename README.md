# wayang

A Java library for displaying images on the
[Ableton Push 2](https://www.ableton.com/en/push/) instrument. The
project name, which refers to
[Javanese shadow puppet performances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayang),
was chosen because it ties together the concepts Java, Push, and
images.
